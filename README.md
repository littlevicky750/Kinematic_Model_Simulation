# Kinematic_Model_Simulation

Matlab Simulink model for Sensor-Driver-Controller System.
For varity the kinematic.
For simulating the unbalance situation of two different link.
The "Check Difference" block is just a demonstration to solve the unbalance problem. The possibility for doing this by current sensor hasn't be varified yet.
